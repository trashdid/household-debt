# Household Debt Project
This project is for visualizing the [Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/household_debt/).

## Background
This is a project that is intended for me to develop skills in a few realms of software development. The initial skills
I want to work on are Data Pipelines, Database Development, APIs, and Webpage Development. The tools I would like to start 
with are [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/), [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), 
and [React](https://react.dev/).
